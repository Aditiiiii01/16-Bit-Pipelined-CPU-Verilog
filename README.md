# 16-bit Pipelined CPU in Verilog

## Overview
This project implements a 16-bit pipelined CPU (5-stage) in Verilog with:
- Hazard detection and forwarding
- IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB pipeline registers
- ALU, register file, and control unit
- Basic instruction memory and data memory

## Repository Structure

## Simulation
1. Open `cpu_tb.v` in ModelSim or your preferred simulator.
2. Run the simulation to verify pipeline execution.
3. Observe pipeline registers, ALU outputs, and register file for correctness.
